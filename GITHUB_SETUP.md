# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## 🐙 Setting Up Your GitHub Repository

Since I can't directly create a GitHub repository for you, here are the exact steps to do it yourself:

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in to your account
2. **Click the "+" icon** in the top right corner
3. **Select "New repository"**
4. **Repository settings:**
   - **Repository name:** `backpain-manager-pro`
   - **Description:** `Professional-grade back pain management application - $30k+ healthcare software with clinical compliance`
   - **Visibility:** Choose Public or Private
   - **DON'T initialize** with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

### Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
# Add the GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/backpain-manager-pro.git

# Push the code to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Verify Upload

1. **Refresh your GitHub repository page**
2. **You should see all the project files:**
   - src/ folder with all React components
   - package.json with dependencies
   - README.md with comprehensive documentation
   - TERMUX_SETUP.md with mobile setup guide
   - All other project files

## 📱 For Termux Access

Once your repository is on GitHub, you can access it from Termux using:
