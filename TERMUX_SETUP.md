# 📱 Termux Setup Guide - BackPain Pro v2.1

## 🚀 **Getting the New Enhanced Features in Termux**

If you're still seeing the old version, follow these steps to get the new features working:

### **Step 1: Navigate to Your Project Directory**
```bash
# Make sure you're in the right directory
cd ~
ls -la

# You should see backpain-manager-pro folder
# If you see "Last-one" or old folder name, that's the issue!
```

### **Step 2: Update to Latest Code**
```bash
# If you have the old folder, backup and get fresh copy
mv backpain-manager-pro backpain-old-backup

# Clone the latest version
git clone https://github.com/bullsbears682/backpain-manager-pro.git
cd backpain-manager-pro

# Verify you have the latest code
git log --oneline -3
# Should show: "Fix Cache Issues - Force New Features to Load"
```

### **Step 3: Clean Installation**
```bash
# Remove any old dependencies
rm -rf node_modules
rm -f package-lock.json

# Install fresh dependencies
npm install

# Create missing icons directory (common Termux issue)
mkdir -p public/icons
cp public/icon-*.png public/icons/ 2>/dev/null || echo "Icons copied or already exist"
```

### **Step 4: Clear All Caches**
```bash
# Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force

# Clear any build cache
rm -rf dist/
rm -rf .cache/

# Clear browser data (if using Termux browser)
# You'll need to manually clear browser cache/data
```

### **Step 5: Start the Enhanced App**
```bash
# Build fresh version
npm run build

# Start development server
npm start
```

### **Step 6: Access the App**
```bash
# The app should be running on:
# http://localhost:3000
# or
# http://127.0.0.1:3000

# If you see port already in use:
pkill -f "npm start"
pkill -f "node"
npm start
```

   # Should show: "Fix Cache Issues - Force New Features to Load"
   ```

3. **Check Package Version:**
   ```bash
   grep '"version"' package.json
   # Should show: "version": "2.1.0"
   ```

4. **Force Browser Cache Clear:**
   - Close all browser tabs
   - Clear browser data/cache in browser settings
   - Restart browser
   - Visit: `http://localhost:3000/clear-cache.html`

   cd backpain-manager-pro
   npm install
   mkdir -p public/icons

## 📞 **Still Having Issues?**

If you're still seeing the old version after following all steps:

1. **Screenshot what you see** - this helps identify the issue
2. **Check your git log** to confirm you have the latest code
3. **Try a different browser** in Termux
4. **Clear ALL app data** for your browser
5. **Restart Termux completely**

The new features are definitely there - it's usually a caching or directory issue in Termux environments.
